# Programming-Languages
These are the course projects that were given for the class programming language concepts with professor Ryan Gerald.
For some of these assigments professor ryan provided the definition files and asked us to edit and add to it.
The final project was to develop an interpreter for a language with simple rules. The interpreter used a self build recusive descend parser
and a self build lexical analyzer.
